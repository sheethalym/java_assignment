<h1><b>Numerical investigation on effect of pins on heat transfer characteristics of gas turbine blades</b></h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>The work deals with introduction of inline pin Ô¨Åns as extended surfaces in wedge duct which is trailing portion of a gas turbine blade. The effect of increase in surface area and turbulence on heat transfer and pressure drop will be compared with the values of smooth duct</p>
